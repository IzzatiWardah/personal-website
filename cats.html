                        <h3>My Favourite Cat</h3>
                        <p style="font-size: 20PX;">As we all know, cats have their own version of breed. Each cat might came from a certain breed and some of the breed are so rare that the price for these rare cats are almost 20,000$ if auctioned. Here are some list of my favorite
                            breed when it comes to cat.</p>
                        <figure class="figure"></figure>
                        <div class="row">
                            <div class="col-md-6">
                                <figure class="figure"><img class="rounded img-fluid figure-img" src="assets/img/scenery/brits.jpg" alt="A generic square placeholder image with rounded corners in a figure." style="font-size: 20px;"></figure>

                                <h3>The British Shorthair</h3>
                                <p>The British Shorthairs are sociable,<br>affectionate and more reserved than the other cats, becoming close to their<br>owners and getting along very well with the other furry members of the<br>household. On the other hand,
                                    however, they dislike being carried away. They<br>descend from the domestic cats of the Roman Empire, known for their outstanding<br>hunting ability and strength, although the modern breed has evolved to be a<br>little
                                    clumsier than its ancestors. They are well known for their copper paws,<br>and most of all, they have a superb blue-gray fur coat that looks so sleek and<br>silky. The British Shorthair price tag is up to $1,500.<br><br></p>

                                    <h3>The Scottish Fold</h3>
                                    <p>Mostly known for their adorable turned down paws, the Scottish Fold are faithful companions who trace their roots back to a<br>farm in Tayside, Scotland, in the 1960s, when a farmer noticed their cute<br>characteristics
                                        and wanted to establish a new breed. In general, they make<br>happy and energetic pets and love to receive attention. The downside of this<br>breed is that it is vulnerable to degenerative joint tissues. The price
                                        of the<br>Scottish Fold goes up to $3,000.<br></p>

                                <h3>The Persian</h3>
                                <p>Although their origins were traced back to Persia in the 19th century,<br>it seems that the Persian had existed hundreds of years before Christ. Nowadays<br>it's connected to old Hollywood beauty and reputation. Their long
                                    fur looks<br>luxurious and sophisticated and blends perfectly with their sparkling eyes,<br>impressing almost everyone with their presence. The price is also remarkable,<br>going up to $5,500.<br></p>
