                        <h3>My Working Experience</h3>
                        <p style="font-size: 20px;">I would like to share about my experience doing a part time job during my semester break at The Bakerâ€™s Place Bakery. When I started working there, I was taught how to write on a cake, baking and decorate a cake. Once I became
                            proficient in doing so, I became interested in the field of bakery. For me this job was an exciting experience for myself. <br></p>
                        <p style="font-size: 20px;">Because I currently study online only at home, I decided to work on Saturdays and Sundays only because I want to gain more knowledge there. There I also work as a cashier and promoter to attract customers. I also have many friends
                            who have given me a lot of guidance. For me, I will not forget the experiences and memories while working there if I have to continue studying later :)<br></p>

                        <h3>My Education</h3>
                        <h3 style="font-size: 22px;">Kindergarten</h3>
                        <p style="font-size: 20px;">I started entering kindergarten when I was just 4 years old. My first kindergarten is FURQAN kindergarten located in Cheras, Kuala Lumpur. There, I learned to read, count, write and sing which is my favorite activity. I also have
                            chinese and indian friends which I comfortable making friends and sharing stories.<br></p>
                        <p style="font-size: 20px;">After that, when I was 5 and 6 years old, I started entering Othman Islamic Kindergarten because my parents want me to study Islam better. At that time, I diligently understood the Quran, memorized surahs, learned Arabic and other
                            subjects such as faith, morals and so on. I am very happy and grateful to be able to read the Quran at such a young age!<br></p>
                        <h3 style="font-size: 22px;">Primary School</h3>
                        <p style="font-size: 20px;">SK Taman Midah 1 is one and only my primary school. I have a lot of sweet and bitter memories of 6 years at studying there. I also have a lot of good friends there and classmates who are so sporting and friendly<br></p>
                        <p style="font-size: 20px;">While studying there, I often got good exam results and managed to sit first class when I was in 5th and 6th grade. I am also active in participating in various events such as dance performances, fashion competitions and mathematics
                            quiz. Finally, I have got 4A 1B results after sitting for the UPSR exam<br></p><img class="rounded img-fluid" src="assets/img/scenery/prim.png" alt="A generic square placeholder image with rounded corners in a figure." style="width: 400px;">

                            style="font-size: 22px;">Secondary School</h3>
                            <p style="font-size: 20px;">During form 1 to 3, I went to school at SMK Bandar Tun Razak, Cheras that is close to my house because I did not want to be far from my parents. Sometimes, I just walk with my friends to go to and back to school. As soon as
                                I obtained excellent results in PT3, I immediately got an offer to enter the excellent cluster school, which is Technical Institute of Kuala Lumpur<br></p>
                            <p style="font-size: 20px;">At there, I majored in civil engineering and I really enjoy studying it even though it was a little challenging because I took 10 subjects in SPM. But, alhamdullilah I also managed to finish my 2 years at this school with excellent
                                SPM results. I am also active in netball and have represented the school in many competitions. Honestly, I am very grateful because I have many sweet memories when I was in the school.<br></p><img class="rounded img-fluid"

                            <h3 style="font-size: 22px;">University</h3>
                            <p style="font-size: 20px;">After finishing school, I got an offer to continue studying at UiTM Rembau, Diploma in Information Management. I have finally been in the final semester and can't wait to continue my degree!<br></p>
